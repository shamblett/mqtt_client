Addition of web based client, issue 144

If you are an existing user this is a breaking update, the MqttClient class has
now been replaced by the MqttServerClient class. This has exactly the same API as the 
MqttClient class so except for the class rename there should be no other changes.
If you are setting your own websocket protocols the protocol strings now reside
in the MqttConstants class.
