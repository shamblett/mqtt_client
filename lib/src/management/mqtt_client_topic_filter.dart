/// you subscribe to more than one topic or use wildcard topics.
/// Simply construct it, and listen to its message stream rather than
/// that of the client. Note this class will only filter valid receive topics
/// so if you filter on wildcard topics for instance, which you should only
/// subscribe to,  it  will always generate a no match.
