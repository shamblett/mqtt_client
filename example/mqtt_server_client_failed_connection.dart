///
/// To run this example on a linux host please execute 'netcat -l 1883' at the command line.
/// Use a suitably equivalent command for other hosts.
///
/// First create a client, the client is constructed with a broker name, client identifier
/// and port if needed. The client identifier (short ClientId) is an identifier of each MQTT
/// client connecting to a MQTT broker. As the word identifier already suggests, it should be unique per broker.
/// The broker uses it for identifying the client and the current state of the client. If you donâ€™t need a state
/// to be hold by the broker, in MQTT 3.1.1 you can set an empty ClientId, which results in a connection without any state.
/// A condition is that clean session connect flag is true, otherwise the connection will be rejected.
/// The client identifier can be a maximum length of 23 characters. If a port is not specified the standard port
/// of 1883 is used.

/// Connect to a resolvable host that is not running a broker, hence the connection will fail.
/// Set the maximum connection attempts to 3.
