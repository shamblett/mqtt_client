/// An annotated simple subscribe/publish usage example for mqtt_server_client using websockets.
/// Please read in with reference to the MQTT specification. The example is runnable, also refer to
/// test/mqtt_client_broker_test...dart files for separate subscribe/publish tests.

/// First create a client, the client is constructed with a broker name, client identifier
/// and port if needed. The client identifier (short ClientId) is an identifier of each MQTT
/// client connecting to a MQTT broker. As the word identifier already suggests, it should be unique per broker.
/// The broker uses it for identifying the client and the current state of the client. If you don’t need a state
/// to be hold by the broker, in MQTT 3.1.1 you can set an empty ClientId, which results in a connection without any state.
/// A condition is that clean session connect flag is true, otherwise the connection will be rejected.
/// The client identifier can be a maximum length of 23 characters. If a port is not specified the standard port
/// of 1883 is used.

/// A websocket URL must start with ws:// or wss:// or Dart will throw an exception, consult your websocket MQTT broker
/// for details.

  /// list so in most cases you can ignore this. Mosquito needs the single default setting.
